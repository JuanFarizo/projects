Observer:
Is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system. The entity generating the events is an observable

Motivation:
- We need to be informed when certain things happen. ie:
    Object's fields change
    Object do something
    Some external events occurs
- We want to listen to events and notified when they occur
- Typical pattern involves addXXXListener()
- Java has functional objects like Supplier<T> Consumer<T> Function<T>
