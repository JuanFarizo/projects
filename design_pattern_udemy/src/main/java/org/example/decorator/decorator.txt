Motivation:
- Want to augment an object with additional functionality
- Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code (Open-Close Principle)
- Want to keep new functionality separate (Single Responsability Principle)
- Need to be able to ineract with existing strctures
Tow options:
    - Inherit from requiere object if possible; some classes are final
    - Build a Decorator, which simple references the decorated object(s)

Decorator: design pattern facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual 
objects without directly inheriting from them.


Instead of modifying the original object, you end up making these decorators 
which take your original object in the constructor. They aggregate it in a private variable,
and then they provide additional information as well.
