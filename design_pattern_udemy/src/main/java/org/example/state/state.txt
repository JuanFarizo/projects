State
A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transitions)
A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine

So you transition from one state to another. And sometimes these transitions are triggered by some events.
So we have this idea of a trigger as an event which causes a transition from one state to another.

Motivation:
- Given sufficient complexity it pays to formally define possible states and events/triggers
- Can define:
    State entry/exit behaviors
    Action when a particular event causes a transition
    Guard conditions enabling/disabling a transition
    Default action when no transitions are found for an event
