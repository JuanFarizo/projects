State
A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transitions)
A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine

So you transition from one state to another. And sometimes these transitions are triggered by some events.
So we have this idea of a trigger as an event which causes a transition from one state to another.
