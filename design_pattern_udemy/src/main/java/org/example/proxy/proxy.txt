Proxy
A class that functions as an interface to a particular resource.
That resource may be remote, expensive to construct,
o may require loggin or some other added functionality.

The key thing about the proxy is that its interface looks just 
like the interface of the object
that you're actually attempting to access.

Motivation: 
- The proxy basically gives you the same interface as the one that you've been using, 
but it gives you entirely a different behavior behind the scenes.

Example:
    CommunicationProxy
    VirtualProxy
    SelectionProxy
    LogginProxy
    ProtectionProxy: Control access to a particula resource
