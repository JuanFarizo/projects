Chan if responsibility:
A chain of components who all get a chance to process either a command or a query, and they can optionally have some sort of default processing implementation, and they can also terminate the processing chain and thereby preventing the rest of the objects in the chain to actually prevent them from processing this particular command or query.

Motivation:
    Example:
    Unethical behavior by an employee: who takes the blame?
        employee
        manager
        ceo
    Example2:
    You click a graphical element on a form
        Button handles it, tops further processing
        Underlying group box
        underlying window

Summary:
- Chain of responsibility can be implemented as a chain of references or a centralized construct(like event broker)
- Enlist objects in the chain, possibly controlling their order
- Object removal from chain (e.g. in AutoClosable close())
