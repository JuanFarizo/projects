Command Query Separation
So the idea is that whenever we operate on objects, we separate all the invocations into two different concepts which are called query and command.

Command: So a command is something that you send when you're asking for an action or a change. Example: Set your attack value to 2
Query: is asking for information without necessarily changing anything. Give me your attack value
CQS: which means that you have separate means of sending commands and queries.
