Motivation:
- Object creation logic becomes too convulted
- Constructors is not descriptive
Name mandate by name of containing type
Cannot overload with same set of arguments with different names
Can turn into overloading hell
- Wholesale object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsourced to

A separate function (factory method) That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
can create hirarchy of factories with Abstract Factory
Definition: A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.
