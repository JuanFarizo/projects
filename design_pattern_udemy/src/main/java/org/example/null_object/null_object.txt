Null Object:
A behavioral design pattern with no behaviors
A no-op object that conforms to the required interface, satisfying a dependency requirementof some other object

Motivation:
- When component A uses component B, it typically assumes that B is non-null
    Usually
        You inject B, not some Option<B> type
        You do not check for null on every call
- There is no option of telling A not to use an instance of B
    Its use is hard-coded
- Thus we build a no-op, non-functioning inheritor of B(or some interface that B implements) and pass it into A
