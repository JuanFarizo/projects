Strategy
Allows you to partially specify the behavior of the system and then augment it later on.
So the strategy design pattern essentially enables the exact behavior of a system to be selected either at runtime (dynamic strategy) or compile-time (static strategy).

Example:
So many algorithms can actually be decomposed into what I would call the higher and lower level parts.
So the process of making tea can be decomposed into something high level, like the process of making a hot beverage, you have to boil the water, and you have to pour the water into the cup.
So the high level algorithm, which we specified up above the process of boiling water and pouring it into a cup can then be reused. for making something else like coffee or hot chocolate, for example.

Motivation
- Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher and lower level parts
