Mediator
A component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being aware of each other or having direct (reference) access to each other.

Motivation:
- Components may go in and out of a system in any time
- So it makes no sense for the different participants to have direct references to one another because those references can go dead at any time.
Solution: have all the referer to some central component that facilitates communication and that component is the mediator.

A clear example of an mediator is a ChatRoom


Summary:
- Create the mediator and have each object in the system refer to it (ej. in a field) a possibility is a constructor injection
- Mediator engages in bidirectional communication with its connected components.
- Mediator has function the components can call
- Components have functions the mediator can call and they can sort of enlist themselves in the process of being notified about something happening.
