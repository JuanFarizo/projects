Recursion
. recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solution to smaller instances of the same problem
. so we break the tasks into smaller and smaller subtasks
· this approach can be applied to several types of problems - this is why recursion is in the center of computer science
. we have to define base-cases to avoid infinite loops
· every problem can be solved either with iteration(this is preferred) or with recursion.

TAIL RECURSION
- if the recursive function call occurs at the end of the function then it is called tail recursion
- tail recursion is similar to a loop (for loop or while loop)
- this method executes all the statements before jumping to the next recursive call

HEAD RECURSION
- if the recursive function call occurs at the beginning of the function then it is called head recursion
- This approach saves the state of the function call before jumping into the next recursive call
- It means that head recursion needs more memory because of the states it stores
